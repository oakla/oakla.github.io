Stats

Today I learned about permutation testing. If you have two groups, and some stat for each group (e.g. mean weight loss over time), you can use permutation testing to see if the difference between the stat for each group is statistically significant for some $\alpha$.

Learning Resources

FreeCodeCamp has an [SQL and Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-and-databases-full-course/), but it's just a video without a certificate. Coursea also has a free course that presumably gives you a certificate. (edit: ugh, the certificate is not free)
