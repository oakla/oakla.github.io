Today I vomitted all kinds of thoughts, plans, requirements I have regarding time management. It's still a bit of a pile of vomit, but one clear want is to have a tool that tells me, with the use due(or scheduled) dates and time estimates, what I have on, and how this compares to my capacity for that day.

I also begun trying Amazing Marvin. So far so good. At least it's much more responsive than Click-Up so far.
